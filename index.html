    <h1>The Internet Has Been Taken Over By Cats.</h1>

    <p>It is almost impossible to go surfing on the web and not come across a picture, or something to do with cats. They are most popular on these websites:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Facebook</li>
        <li>Reddit</li>
        <li>Tumblr</li>
    
    </ul>
    
    <p>"Cats have shaped a massive Internet culture based on nothing but images and videos of cats playing pianos, jumping in boxes, riding invisible bikes, taking naps, or breaking your furniture. I think cats are easily relatable to people due to how quirky and expressive they are, and any cat-related media seems to keep the attention of even the fastest-browsing Internet viewer." -Chris Torres, the creator of <a href="http://www.nyan.cat/"> Nyan Cat</a>.</p>
    
    <h2> There are many different fads to do with cats, including:</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Cat Shaming</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

        <li>And the notorious <em>Grumpy Cat</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Of course, there are a number of other factors to consider when trying to work out why the Web loves cats so much. Perhaps it's the aloof attitude. Or maybe, as Ben points out, it could be our need to treat pets as children: "There is a huge demographic shift happening in the US. People are having children later and also living longer, which gives us more opportunities to treat our pets as replacement kids. As the pets become more integral part of our lives, we talk about them and through them a lot."

So, while there seem to be a number of reasons why the domestic kitty rules the Internet, its personable temperament and how much it features in our everyday life are clearly big factors. The best way to sum it up, though? We keep coming back to Chris's suggestion: Maybe the Internet really is made of cats.</p>
